# SARSA, Q-Learning & Reccurent Reinforcement Learning apply to finance - ML Finance Project ENSAE 2020

In recent years, artificial intelligence has become more and more popular in quantitative finance. One main subject is the applications of machine learning algorithms into trading. In this project, we focus on asset trading to implement reinforced algorithms (SARSA, Q-Learning and Recurrent Reinforcement Learning) and compare how well they deliver to produce trading strategies.
